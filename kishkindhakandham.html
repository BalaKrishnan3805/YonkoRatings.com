                    <h3>Review:</h3>
                    <p>The way this movie starts right off by placing the gun and Appupillai at the centre and then moves on by slowly revealing things to the audience bit by bit was refreshing. The film never loses its momentum and the way it makes you empathize with the characters and the way it makes you shift your thinking on things are just beautiful. People should see it without knowing too much about it and enjoy the way everything unfolds. For some reason, even with some heavy themes, this was kind of a relaxing watch for me and the ending did make me very emotional. It's possible that it could grow on me even more in the future and it may be worth some rewatches..</p>
