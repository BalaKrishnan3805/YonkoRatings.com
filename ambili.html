                    <h3>Review:</h3>
                    <p>Where one generation directors goes with Mass and commercial turnouts, the others working towards the scripts curving down to reality and characters themselves which exists with us who makes us laugh and cry. Well deserved credit goes to both Sobhin and Joh... Compendious screenplay and Fantastic acting display overall. Storyline is predictable but well goes with the emotions.. Appreciate the overall attempt.. Naveen's debut movie, good show overall....</p>
