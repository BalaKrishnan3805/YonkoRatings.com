                    <h3>Review:</h3>
                    <p>To start with, this movie is just brilliant in every aspect. It beautifully shows the other side of Love.

                        I must say that Varun Dhawan is the central character of this film. He has effortlessly played his character of "Dan". After Badlapur, he has acted brilliantly in this movie. Banita Sandhu is also very good but she rarely has any dialogues in the complete movie.
                        
                        At some point you will feel that this movie is slow but you have to bit patient to understand this movie. You will definitely feel that emotion of Love with happiness and sometimes sadness. But it's a very beautiful movie.</p>
