                    <h3>Review:</h3>
                    <p>The movie starts with an apt intro detailing the nature of Suyambulingam , a honest and hard working family man. But his peace is short lived after a very disturbing derogatory event . The Story then catches fire taking us through journey of trickery deception and deceit.

                        Kamals acting is top notch , makes us think whether there is anyone alive who is even remotely as talented .The entire cast delivers. Excellent work by Jeyamohan (Writer) gives us an even more intense and tight movie compared to the original version ! The movie hits the bulls eye in every major spot you would like a movie to - Story , Direction , Writing , Acting etc.
                        
                        Expect a Fast paced thriller ride to experience with your family .</p>
